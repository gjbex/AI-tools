# Models

Directory intended to hold downloaded models. The directory contains scripts to
download the models rather than the models themselves as these are
prohibitively large to store in the repository.


## What is it?

1. `download-mistrallite.sh`: script to download the MISTRAL-Lite model (7B,
   Q4_K_M) from Hugging Face.
