# Data

This directory contains some scripts to download data sets for
the course.  The data sets are too large to be stored in the
repository, so they are downloaded on demand.


## What is it?

1. `download-wikitext-2-raw-v1.sh`: script to download the raw
   WikiText-2 data set.  This data set is used by convention to assess
   the accuracy of language models after, e.g., quantization.
1. `openmp_faq.html`: HTML file containing the OpenMP FAQ.
